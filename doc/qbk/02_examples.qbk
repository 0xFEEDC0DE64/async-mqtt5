[section:examples Examples]
The main class in __Self__ is __Client__, and the upcoming examples will briefly explain how to use it.

The first examples will show two common uses of an MQTT client: as the publisher and as the receiver.

* [link async_mqtt5.examples.publisher The publisher]
* [link async_mqtt5.examples.receiver The receiver]

The following section will show how to use different underlying transport protocols (such as TCP, SSL and WebSocket)
to establish a connection to a MQTT Broker.

* [link async_mqtt5.examples.network_connection Establishing a network connection with different protocols]

The final section will showcase how to use asynchronous functions in __Client__ 
with different __CompletionToken__. 

* [link async_mqtt5.examples.completion_tokens Completion tokens]
	* [link async_mqtt5.examples.callbacks Async functions with callbacks]
	* [link async_mqtt5.examples.cpp20_coroutines Async functions with C++20 coroutines]
	* [link async_mqtt5.examples.futures Async functions with futures]
